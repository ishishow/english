Shoさんへのフィードバックまとめ
Shoさんの英語は、**言いたいことを伝える力（Communicative Competence）**が非常に高いです。文法ミスがあっても、文脈や補足説明で相手に理解させています。これは素晴らしいスキルです。

次のステップとして意識すべき点:

動詞の語法:

work as a ~ (〜として働く)

live in ~ (〜に住む)

go to ~ (〜へ行く)

これら基本動詞の前置詞や目的語のセットを塊で覚えると、もっとスムーズになります。

比較級の構文:

Compared to ~ を文頭に置くテクニックを使うと、日本とフィリピンの比較などが楽になります。

発音 (RとL):

最後の "Lavish" (豪華な) が "Rubbish" (ゴミ) と認識されてしまったのは、典型的なL/Rの発音の違いによるものです。ここだけ意識すると誤解を防げます。

エンジニアとしてリモートワークをしながら海外を旅するスタイル、とても素敵ですね！英語力が上がれば、その自由度はさらに高まるはずです。応援しています！

新しく他のところも改善してみて同じくらいの長さで

承知しました！Shoさんの英語はコミュニケーションの意図が明確で素晴らしいですが、**「語彙の正確さ」と「文のつなぎ方」**を磨くと、さらに知的でプロフェッショナルな印象になります。

先ほど触れなかった箇所を中心に、さらに徹底的にブラッシュアップします。

1. 冒頭の挨拶と自己紹介 (0:27 - 0:42)
Original: My name, what a minor name. My name is, Sho. Correction: Sorry, what was your name again? My name is Sho.

解説: "what a minor name" はおそらく "What is my name?" か相手の名前を聞こうとして混乱した箇所かと思います。相手の名前を聞くときは "May I have your name?" や、カジュアルに "I'm Sho. And you are?" が自然です。

Original: No, I'm actually working. Yeah, this is a holiday, so, yeah, day off, Correction: Even though today is a holiday, I'm actually working.

解説: 「祝日だけど働いている」という逆接の状況なので、Even though（〜だけれども）を使うと一発で伝わります。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"I'm on the clock right now." (今、勤務時間中です)

2. サービスの確認 (2:19)

Shoさん、2つ目のトランスクリプトのご共有ありがとうございます！ 今回もOtter AI特有の聞き間違い（SumoがSmallになっていたり、MactanがMarkdownになっていたり）がありますが、Shoさんの英語は文脈がしっかりしているので、言いたいことはクリアに伝わっています。

特に後半の「お父さんとのゴルフの話」や「仕事の悩み」は、とても人間味があって面白い会話でした。これらをより洗練された英語にするための修正とアドバイスをまとめました。

1. 健康意識について (1:20 - 2:01)
Original: I think Japanese are really health conscious... I want to live healthy sea life. Correction: I think Japanese people are really health-conscious. I want to live a healthy lifestyle.

解説: "healthy sea life"（健康的な海の生活？）は "lifestyle" の聞き間違いか言い間違いですね。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"Health nut" (健康オタク)

"You are what you eat." (食べるものが体を作る＝食生活は大事だ)

"I try to watch what I eat." (食事に気をつけている)

2. 韓国人留学生の増加 (4:40 - 5:10)
Original: I had the number of Korean people, student increased I had recently. Correction: I heard that the number of Korean students has increased recently.

解説: "I had"（私は持っていた）ではなく "I heard"（私は聞いた）が正解です。また、"the number of ~ increased"（〜の数が増えた）という構文をきれいに繋げましょう。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"There's been a surge in Korean students." (韓国人学生が急増している)

"They are flocking to Cebu." (彼らはセブに押し寄せている＝たくさん集まっている)

3. 日本のビーチ事情 (6:04 - 6:50)
Original: Green beach in Japan is very fast and expensive. (※Green -> Clean, fast -> far) Correction: Clean beaches in Japan are very far and expensive to get to.

Original: So it's rarely, it's a normal to see beautiful ocean. Correction: So, it's rare to see such a beautiful ocean. / It's not normal for us to see clear water nearby.

解説: "It's rarely"（めったに〜ない）と "It's normal"（普通だ）が混ざってしまっています。「めったに見られない」と言いたい場合は "It's rare" で統一します。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"Pristine beaches." (手つかずの美しいビーチ)

"Crystal clear water." (透き通った水)

"It's a trek to get there." (そこに行くのは骨が折れる旅だ＝遠い)

4. オリンピックと日本のスポーツ (13:20 - 13:58)
Original: Sho but small, small and Judo like these two... (※Small -> Sumo) Correction: Sumo and Judo are famous.

Original: The athlete of small and last, It opens. Judo very strong. Can get gold medal Olympics. Correction: Sumo wrestlers and Judo athletes are very strong. They often win gold medals at the Olympics.

解説: 主語（They/Judo athletes）と動詞（win）を補うと文が安定します。"Can get" だけだと誰が取るのか不明確になります。

Original: So it is famous to to compare with, to compare the other country as a country... Correction: Compared to other countries, Japanese athletes are famous for these sports.

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"They are heavy hitters." (彼らは有力選手だ／重要人物だ)

"Bring home the gold." (金メダルを持ち帰る＝獲得する)

5. ゴルフを始めた理由 (14:10 - 14:53)
Original: I studied playing golf this year. Correction: I started playing golf this year. / I took up golf this year.

解説: スポーツを「始める」ときは "study" ではなく "start" や "take up" を使います。

Original: My father insist, yeah, to play golf. Correction: My father insisted that I play golf.

Original: I have no way. I have no way to obey. Correction: I had no choice. I had no choice but to obey him.

解説: "I have no way" は「方法がない」という意味になります。「選択肢がなかった（従うしかなかった）」と言いたい場合は "no choice" です。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"My dad twisted my arm." (父に無理やり説得された ※直訳は腕を捻るですが、比喩表現です)

"He wouldn't take no for an answer." (彼はNOという返事を受け入れなかった＝強引だった)

Original: But my father, my father changed my club soccer to baseball. Correction: But my father made me switch from soccer to baseball.

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"I stuck with baseball for years." (何年も野球を続けた)

"He steered me towards baseball." (彼は私を野球の方向へ誘導した)

7. お父さんとの勝負 (17:50 - 18:00)
Original: I don't have mind to win my father. Correction: I don't intend to beat my father. / I don't think I can beat him.

解説: 試合で相手に勝つことは "win" ではなく "beat" を使います。"Win the game" ですが "Beat the father" です。"Win my father" だと「お父さんを賞品として勝ち取る」という意味になってしまいます！

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"He's out of my league." (彼は私とはレベルが違う＝強すぎる)

"He wipes the floor with me." (彼は私を完膚なきまでに叩きのめす＝圧勝する)

8. 仕事の退屈さと転職理由 (18:57 - 19:31)
Original: Sho language is Japanese. (※Company language?) Correction: The official language of the company is Japanese.

Original: Project boarding is boring. Repetition of job. Correction: The project I'm on is boring. It's just repetitive work.

解説: "Project boarding" はおそらく "Project I'm boarding" (参加している) かもしれませんが、シンプルに "The project I'm on" や "Current project" でOKです。

9. 残業スキル (24:13 - 24:32)
Original: I have over time worker skills every day. Correction: I have the stamina to work overtime every day. / I'm used to working overtime.

解説: 「残業スキル」という面白い表現ですが、英語では「スタミナがある」や「慣れている」と表現するのが自然です。

Original: I have those skills, but I didn't. I don't use it decently. Correction: I have the capacity to work hard, but I don't use it currently because the job is boring.

解説: "Decently"（きちんとした）より "Currently"（現在は）や "Recently"（最近は）が文脈に合います。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"I can burn the midnight oil." (夜遅くまで働ける)

"I'm a workaholic." (仕事中毒だ ※自虐的に使う)

"I'm grinding away." (身を粉にして働いている)

解説: "I was scary" だと「私自身が怖い人だった」という意味になります。「私が怖がっている」は "I am scared" です。

Original: Important, they are not a real one. Correction: It's important to remember that they are not real humans.

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"AI is advancing at a rapid pace." (AIは急速に進歩している)

"Job security is a concern." (雇用の安定が懸念事項だ)

"We need to future-proof our careers." (将来を見据えてキャリアを守る必要がある)

Shoさんへの今回のフィードバック
会話の内容が深くなっていて素晴らしいです！特にお父さんとのエピソード（サッカーから野球へ、そしてゴルフへ）は、具体的で話し相手も興味を持ちやすいトピックでした。

今回のレベルアップポイント:

「勝つ」の使い分け (Win vs Beat):

Win + 試合/賞品 (game, match, prize, gold medal)

Beat + 対戦相手 (my father, the other team, him)

ここを間違えると「お父さんを賞品としてもらう」になっちゃうので注意です！

感情の形容詞 (Scary vs Scared):

I am scared. (私は怖がっている)

It is scary. (それは怖い)

"I am scary" と言うと、Shoさんが「ホラー映画の怪物のように怖い人」になってしまいます。

「〜させる」(Make/Force):

お父さんに「ゴルフをやらされた」「野球に変えさせられた」という文脈では、My father made me play baseball. が一番自然なニュアンスです。

お仕事が忙しい中でのレッスン、本当に尊敬します！ "Burning the midnight oil" しすぎないように体調には気をつけてくださいね！

19:18

Celebrity,

S

Speaker 1

22:18

All right, um, Sho, do you want to be famous in the future?

S

Speaker 1

22:33

Actually, it's the same with your answer. I don't need to be a well known person to become a well known person. I because I want privacy, so I want to enjoy my life. That's all my simple life. Yeah, yeah.

S

Speaker 1

23:21

Yeah, because you have the right to choose people who will be part of your life, yeah, people who will take care of your mental health, and those who will make you feel

Shoさん、3つ目のトランスクリプトもありがとうございます！ 今回のデータは、Otter AIがShoさんの声をあまり拾えておらず、先生（Speaker 1）の声がメインになっています。ただ、先生のリアクション（"Oh, you applied for it" や "You want privacy" など）から、Shoさんが何を話したかは推測できます。

今回は**「Shoさんが言いたかったであろう内容」を推測し、それを「もっとカッコよく、自然に言うためのフレーズ」**として再構成しました。

1. 東京での生活とクリスマスの予定 (0:56 - 2:17)
Context: 東京に何年住んでいるか、そしてクリスマスの予定（男だけで集まる）について。 Reconstructed Idea: I've lived in Tokyo for 8 years. For Christmas, I'm just going to hang out with my guy friends.

✨ Better Expressions:

"I've been a Tokyoite for 8 years now."

Tokyoite (東京っ子、東京在住者) という単語を使うとこなれた感じになります。

"We're having a guys' night out for Christmas."

男だけで集まることを Guys' night と言います。

"It's going to be a 'boys only' gathering."

女性なしの、という意味を強調する場合に使います。

2. シェアハウスの管理 (2:20 - 2:47)
Context: 50人の住人との共同生活をどうコントロールしているか。 Reconstructed Idea: It's hard to manage, but we have rules. / "Hoka no Toko" (他のところ？)

✨ Better Expressions:

"It can be chaotic with 50 people."

Chaotic (カオスな、ごちゃごちゃした) はシェアハウスの賑やかさを表すのに最適です。

"We have strict house rules to keep things in order."

秩序を保つためにルールがある、という表現。

"Respecting boundaries is key."

「お互いの境界線（プライバシー）を尊重することが鍵です」という意味。

3. ゴルフの腕前とコンペ (5:30 - 6:41)
Context: 腕前は中級者(Intermediate)。コンペの結果について（勝てなかった）。 Reconstructed Idea: I'm an intermediate player. I didn't win, but I enjoyed it.

✨ Better Expressions:

"I'd say I'm an average player."

Intermediate も正しいですが、会話では average（平均的）や decent（そこそこ）がよく使われます。

"I'm still working on my handicap."

「ハンディキャップを縮めようと頑張っている」＝「もっと上手くなろうとしている」というゴルフ特有の言い回し。

"I didn't place in the tournament, but it was good experience."

「順位には入らなかった（入賞しなかった）」を didn't place と言います。

4. 大谷翔平選手の試合観戦 (9:36 - 10:08)
Context: チケットに応募した（抽選）。 Reconstructed Idea: I applied for the tickets. / I entered the lottery.

✨ Better Expressions:

"I entered the ticket lottery."

日本のチケット「抽選」システムは Lottery と言います。

"I'm hoping to score some tickets."

Score は「（入手困難なものを）手に入れる」というスラング的な動詞です。

"Fingers crossed I get them!"

「当たりますように！（指をクロスさせて祈る）」という決まり文句。

5. 相撲観戦と場所 (15:59 - 16:45)
Context: 両国（Ryogoku）で相撲が行われる。 Reconstructed Idea: Sumo is held in Ryogoku. It's the biggest region/arena.

✨ Better Expressions:

"The Grand Sumo Tournament is held at Ryogoku Kokugikan."

「本場所」は Grand Sumo Tournament と呼びます。

"Ryogoku is the spiritual home of Sumo."

「相撲の聖地」というニュアンスを出したい時に Spiritual home や Mecca of Sumo と言います。

6. 競馬とギャンブル (17:26 - 18:02)
Context: 競馬はギャンブルのようなもの。賭けたことがある。 Reconstructed Idea: It's like gambling. I bet money and choose a horse.

✨ Better Expressions:

"I occasionally place a bet on the horses."

「馬に賭ける」は place a bet on the horses。

"It's just a little flutter."

Flutter はイギリス英語寄りですが、「少額の気楽なギャンブル」を指すおしゃれな単語です。

"I do it for the thrill, not the money."

「お金のためじゃなく、スリル（興奮）のためにやっている」

7. 有名人への憧れとプライバシー (22:33 - 24:40)
Context: 有名人になりたい？いいえ、プライバシーが欲しいから。普通の生活がいい。 Reconstructed Idea: I don't want to be famous. I want privacy and a simple life. Being famous has pros and cons.

✨ Better Expressions:

"I value my privacy too much to be famous."

「有名になるには、プライバシーを大事にしすぎている（＝プライバシーが大事だから有名になりたくない）」

"Fame comes with a price."

「名声には代償が伴う」という格言的な表現。

"Living in the spotlight is stressful."

In the spotlight（スポットライトを浴びる生活）はストレスだ。

"I prefer a low-key life."

Low-key（控えめな、目立たない）生活を好む。Simple lifeのより現代的な言い方です。

8. 有名人との結婚 (25:00 - 25:22)
Context: 有名人と結婚したい？ それは大変そう（Challenging）。 Reconstructed Idea: It would be difficult/challenging.

✨ Better Expressions:

"That would be too much drama for me."

「それはドラマ（波乱）が多すぎるよ」＝大変すぎる。

"It comes with too much baggage."

Baggage（手荷物）は、比喩的に「面倒な事情」や「精神的な負担」を指します。

"I wouldn't want the media scrutiny."

Scrutiny（精査、監視）。メディアにじろじろ見られるのは嫌だ、という意味。

Shoさんへの総合フィードバック
今回の会話は、**「自分の価値観（プライバシー重視、普通の生活が好き）」**をしっかり伝えられていたのが印象的です。先生も "I totally agree with you" と共感していましたね。

今回のレベルアップポイント:

「抽選」の説明:

海外ではチケットが先着順であることが多いので、日本の "Lottery system"（抽選制度）は少し説明が必要な場合があります。

In Japan, popular tickets are sold by lottery system, not first-come, first-served. （日本では人気チケットは早い者勝ちではなく、抽選なんです）と言えると完璧です。

「中級」の言い換え:

Intermediate は少し教科書的な響きがあります。

謙遜するなら I'm still learning（まだ勉強中です）、自信があるなら I can hold my own（そこそこやれます）など、ニュアンスで使い分けるとカッコいいです。

相槌のバリエーション:

先生の話を聞いている時、恐らく "I see" や "Yeah" を多用されていると思います（音声認識されにくいので）。

That makes sense.（なるほど、筋が通ってますね）

I can imagine.（想像できます/そうでしょうね）

これらを混ぜると、会話のリズムがさらに良くなります。

今回も多岐にわたるトピックで素晴らしい練習量ですね！ぜひ Guys' night や Ticket lottery などのフレーズを使ってみてください。

3:22

hours.

Yeah, enough sleep.



3:27

Oh yes, yeah, even though you stay up late in the evening, but you get up late also. That's why you can still get enough sleep, having the eight hours, the recommended eight hours? Yes, obviously I think, okay, so why do you need? Why you don't need to go to the office? Are you working at home?



3:49

Yes, I can work at home. I'm a software engineer, so I don't have to go my office, go to my office and I don't need to talk about some clients face to face.



4:08

Wow, software engineer, I

4:19

really convenient. Yes, it's really convenient.



4:23

I see okay, yeah, thank you for sharing about that. Sho Alright, so now you have chosen five minutes discussion and what topic



4:32

you would like to talk about. Honestly, I didn't choose I didn't choose any specific topics. Do you have any suggestion?



4:47

Okay, so,



4:53

how about the topic number one or number



4:56

two? Okay, okay, let's talk about Wow, this. Okay,



5:02

yeah, discrimination,



5:04

okay, so what comes on your mind when you hear the word discrimination,



5:13

discrimination,



5:18

let me search, yeah, actual meaning, discrimination, okay, maybe I know, but it's serious meaning, I think so maybe such. Yeah, yeah,



5:37

oh.



5:42

We when I heard discrimination, when I hear



5:48

I think that discrimination, it's



5:58

tough topic.



6:01

Sometimes. And



6:03

every



6:06

a lot of people discuss about this topic,



6:12

even now maybe I mean even current, current, yeah, all over the world.



6:26

Yeah, that's correct.



6:28

I imagine this word that is related to some inter internet country, country or skin,



6:46

country, area and the skin, I think,



6:49

yeah. And also here, when we talk about, like, language, right? Yeah, yeah. So sometimes, like, since we are not native speaker of English, sometimes, yeah, some, like, they discriminate how we pronounce the words about our accent, yeah? Sometimes it happened, oh, yeah, even here in Philippines, yeah, because we have, like, Filipinos have a thick accent, yeah, some, some Filipinos discriminate other Filipinos because of the thick accent of speaking. Okay, it also happened,



7:31

I thought some over us, student, discrete,



7:37

ah, no, no, no, I've never encountered,



7:42

yeah, you are student, yeah, describe,



7:49

yeah, discriminating, discriminating, okay, yeah, I've never had any



7:54

experience, okay,



7:56

yeah, that's good, yeah, It means that Japanese people are good, yeah, okay, yeah, so in that case, Sho, why do you Think that discrimination exists?



8:17

Yeah, is



8:21

it a



8:22

difficult topic for you?



8:23

We like our human like teams, and human won't want



8:33

teammates.



8:40

Such, yeah, somebody



8:51

Yeah, humor, always want their fellow him, want to find their company also,



9:05

yeah, and want to create some more target, opposite,



9:17

then discrimination.



9:19

It's happened. I think



9:21

I see okay, yeah, because, like, yeah, as what you said, We want someone like, much with our personality, much with our characteristics, yeah, much with Yeah. So that's why discrimination happened. So how about on your own experience? Have you ever tried it somewhat discriminate, you or no.



9:46

Maybe no,



9:48

no, that's good.



9:50

I've never, never happened. I never experienced this situation.



9:58

But have you like have you witnessed? Have you ever witnessed like discrimination?



10:07

It is difficult to judge the discrimination is, yeah, it depends on Sho. Sho,



10:21

it's difference what they what we think and what we feel.



10:33

If I go to some,



10:41

yeah, it's



10:49

difficult if I go to



10:52

Philippine and I,



10:59

I am if I go to Philippine, I can be target over some third children and



11:13

third children and some other People to Yeah, because I am Japanese, I am a foreigner, so



11:26

it seems I have money so, but it is not Discrimination, I think. But some of Japanese feel that we just to our list,



11:51

but it's small discrimination and we in the past, yeah, it's big reason about discrimination, I think, yeah, previously, Some country, embedded, embedded, actual, yeah, yeah, so colonized,



12:20

yeah. Colonized



12:23

previously in the past, so yeah, colonize the country.



12:33

Country people have have feeling, some negative feeling about the colonizing country people even,



12:50

yeah,



12:54

it's a normal feeling and normal emotion,



12:59

yeah, yeah, that's right.



13:04

I Yeah, that is what I want. I meant I wanted to say,



13:09

yeah, yeah, yeah. You know also Philippines experience, like, being colonized by Spain, yeah. And so Filipinos, like, we also the experience discriminated by this pain, because yeah, because of the looks, yeah, and because of the status, yeah, especially the social status, like rich and poor first people, yeah, they're discrimination. It's likely to happen between the social status, so that's why we also had a bad experience with Spain. Yeah, Spain before, but since now, we are already civilized. Like, yes, what you said? It's not likely to happen now, nowadays. Okay, so in that case, yeah, how can we how can we avoid discrimination?



14:03

So it's difficult, yeah, okay, it's difficult because previously,



14:14

it previously some country, colonized some country, and it



14:26

is sorry, let me search, okay, Sho,



14:33

it is fact. It is reality, yeah,



14:36

so



14:39

we can change the past, fact, we can't change first past fact, so



14:49

Some of people have



14:56

negative feeling.



14:59

Country, yeah, but we



15:07

honestly, we realized. We honestly, we know about



15:17

now, now, now people don't have, didn't, don't do that, but



15:26

yeah, that's correct, we



15:29

know, but it's difficult to,



15:35

It's difficult to arrange, my our emotion,



15:42

yeah, so, yeah, it happened



15:46

everywhere.



15:47

Yeah, that's correct, even in social media like Facebook or Instagram. Yeah. There's also discrimination, yeah. So do you think that discrimination and bullying is the same.



16:04

Yes, same, I think so,



16:05

yeah, yes, it's saying, okay, yep. So how about you? Sho like, if you ever, like, get discriminated, how would you react?



16:17

You get discriminated for?



16:23

Honestly, I have not, I've never experienced so I'm not sure, but if I, if I, how



16:36

would you react if I am



16:38

discriminated I would if I was discriminated, I



16:45

I, if I am discriminated, I will



16:50

React, React to nothing, react, silence.



16:54

Ah, I see, ignore,



16:57

ignore them.



16:59

Yeah, you will just ignore it. Yeah, I think it's the best.



17:03

Just ignore it. But have negative emotion about that, about those people, and then



17:12

go to my room and go to bed, eat a lot.



17:20

Story, yeah, to convert my story,



17:24

yeah, okay. Is that what you do when you get stressed, you eat a lot,



17:30

yes, oh,



17:34

yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, we will be like we we will be hurt, right? It's great for our feelings, but we you will just ignore it, and then, yeah, as you said, you will go to your room and eat a lot



17:54

and go to sleep early.



17:57

Best solution,



17:58

yeah, yeah, to forget everything.



18:02

Yeah, Okay, last question, do you think males and females are equal?



18:13

The



18:23

Hmm, it's not equal. I think,



18:26

aha, okay, but



18:29

I can't.



18:31

I can do I can't specify. I can't distinguish which is better? I can't, yeah, I can't. I don't know.



18:47

I don't know which, which sex is better,



18:53

okay, yeah, yeah, okay. But for you, it's not equal, but you can't define who is more better, yeah, I see Yeah, because we Yeah,



19:08

because what?



19:10

Okay, because we have different like, we, we are unique, right? We have different characteristic, we have different abilities. Yeah, okay, and



19:24

I see okay in Philippines, in Philippines, yeah. You know, it's been like an issue before, if we consider male and female as the same or equal, yeah. And so a lot of females said, Oh, we can do the things that the men do, yeah, but, but for me, I think yes, sometimes what, especially when it comes to physical activity, right? So there are some activities that women can do, yeah, but men can do, but there are some also, like, unique characteristic of women that men can't do also, yeah. So I think, yeah. I think it's equal.



20:11

Yeah, it's equal in different pace. Yes.



20:16

Okay, all right, yet, so much for that topic. A Sho. So this time, let's have another topic. How about let's talk about sports.



20:25

Okay,



20:27

okay. Do you play any sports?



20:30

Yes, I recently started to play golf.



20:37

Okay, how about before, when you were student,



20:40

when I was a student, I had played baseball for a long time,



20:47

okay, but how about now? Can you still play no baseball? I quit. I



20:54

20:56

Ah, okay, yeah. And so recently, you just started playing golf. How about golf? Is it



21:05

fun? Yeah, it is fun.



21:07

Okay, I guess it's expensive. In Japan, playing



21:12

21:15

we don't practice.



21:18

We



21:21

I am.



21:24

I don't practice every



21:27

day, so it's not expensive. Yeah, I can I go to play golf land. Go, go play golf



21:43

once a month, once a month. So it is affordable, yeah. I



21:49

see, okay, since you didn't go every day, yeah, only once a month. So every



21:55

day it's like, very expensive. We can't do that.



22:00

I see, okay, Yeah, same here in Philippines, it's also expensive, okay, since, like, for how long or when did



22:12

you start playing



22:12

golf? Obviously, I've studied this year since this year, so for eight months or nine months,



22:24

but



22:24

I enthusiastic about it,



22:28

wow. Okay, what makes you become interested to play golf?



22:34

I think golf is not important. I think, Okay, I like going to some forest area with my friend.



22:49

It's good, good, good aspect of golf. I see, I see,



22:58

okay, so it's not about the like the game, but it's about like the banding you have with your friends, and also the place that you like to go at first, we



23:10

then, did we then



23:15

go, go To and drive the place, golf, golf round, and then we play it, and we can enjoy eating,



23:29

oh, go



23:31

after, yeah, yeah, and we enjoy eating dinner and drive.



23:41

So it's a small package,



23:45

yeah, small trip I see. Okay, so you always play with friends. Yes,



23:51

yes.



23:54

Okay, yeah. So how far is like the golf course from your house?



24:00

Depends on course, but normally it takes one or two hours at first three, first, first trip, it's one hours, but the return is very clouded. So three or Hi,



24:20

see, okay, yeah, but like, yeah, you play golf and you play baseball when you were student. But like, Do you love watching sports television? In



24:36

terms of



24:37

watching sports, I like baseball.



24:42

Baseball, okay, yeah,



24:46

Shoさん、4つ目のトランスクリプトのご共有ありがとうございます！ 今回もOtter AIの誤認識（"Sho"という単語が文中に何度も挟まったり、"Ali"が"early"だったり）がありますが、文脈はしっかりと読み取れました。

今回は「差別（Discrimination）」という非常に深く、難しいトピックについて議論されていましたね。抽象的な概念を英語で説明するのは大変ですが、歴史的背景（植民地支配など）にも触れており、非常にレベルの高い挑戦をされています。

それでは、文法修正と、より洗練された表現へのブラッシュアップを行います。

1. 睡眠時間と仕事のスタイル (0:51 - 4:08)
Original: If I success to go to bed at 12, and I'm so happy. Correction: If I manage to go to bed at 12, I'm happy. / If I succeed in going to bed at 12...

解説: "Success" は名詞なので動詞として使えません。succeed in ~ing も正しいですが、日常会話で「なんとか〜する」という時は manage to ~ が自然です。

Original: I don't need to go to my office so I can start my work at 10... Correction: I don't need to commute, so I can start working at 10.

解説: 「オフィスへ行く」は go to the office ですが、「通勤する」という意味の commute を使うと、よりプロフェッショナルに響きます。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"I'm a night owl." (私は夜型人間です)

"I have a flexible schedule." (フレックス制/柔軟なスケジュールで働いています)

"I can skip the morning rush." (朝の通勤ラッシュを避けられます)

2. 差別についての一般論 (5:42 - 9:21)
Original: I think that discrimination, it's tough topic. Correction: I think discrimination is a sensitive / heavy topic.

解説: "Tough" でも通じますが、社会問題としての扱いづらさを表すなら "sensitive"（繊細な）や "heavy"（重い）が適しています。

Original: We like our human like teams, and human won't want teammates. (※音声認識ミスの可能性大) Correction: Humans naturally want to belong to a group. We prefer people who are similar to us.

解説: おそらく「人間は自分と似た仲間を求める（だから違う人を排除する）」と言いたかったのだと推測します。belong to a group（集団に属する）という表現が便利です。

Original: want to create some more target, opposite... Correction: ...and they tend to create targets or opponents.

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"It's human nature to..." (〜するのは人間の本性だ)

"Us vs. Them mentality." (「我々」対「彼ら」という対立構造の考え方)

"Birds of a feather flock together." (類は友を呼ぶ＝似た者同士集まりたがる)

3. 海外での経験と歴史的背景 (10:52 - 13:09)
Original: If I go to Philippine, I can be target over some third children... (※"third" -> "street"?) Correction: If I go to the Philippines, I might become a target for street children or thieves.

Original: It seems I have money so, but it is not Discrimination, I think. Correction: They assume I have money. I don't think that counts as discrimination, though.

解説: "It seems I have money" だと「私はお金を持っているようだ（自分でもそう思う）」になります。「彼らがそう見なしている」場合は They assume ~ や I look like I have money と言います。

Original: colonize the country... embedded... country people have have feeling, some negative feeling... Correction: Because of the history of colonization, people in those countries might harbor deep-rooted negative feelings towards the colonizers.

解説: 非常に高度な文です！

"Embedded"（埋め込まれた）→ Deep-rooted（根深い）

"Negative feeling" → Resentment（恨み、敵意）や Grudge（遺恨）を使うとさらに正確です。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"Historical grievances." (歴史的な苦情・恨み)

"It's a lingering effect of colonization." (植民地支配の名残・後遺症だ)

"We can't rewrite history." (歴史を書き換えることはできない)

4. 差別への対処法 (16:36 - 17:24)
Original: React to nothing, react, silence. Correction: I wouldn't react at all. I would maintain silence / ignore them.

Original: to convert my story (※Story -> Stress?) Correction: ...to vent my stress / to change my mood.

解説: おそらく「ストレスを発散する」か「気分転換する」と言いたかった箇所かと思います。「食べることでストレス発散」は stress eating と言います。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"I would turn a blind eye." (見て見ぬふりをする)

"I wouldn't dignify that with a response." (そんな（酷い）ことに対して、反応してあげるほどの価値はない＝相手にしない)

"Kill them with kindness." (嫌がらせに対して、あえて親切にして相手を黙らせる)

5. 男女平等について (18:23 - 20:16)
Original: It's not equal. I think... I can't distinguish which is better? Correction: I don't think they are equal. But I can't say which gender is superior.

解説: "Distinguish"（区別する）よりも、優劣をつけられないという意味で superior（優れている）を使うのが良いでしょう。

Original: It's equal in different pace. (※Pace -> Ways?) Correction: We are equal, but in different ways.

解説: 「違うペースで」ではなく「違う方法・側面で」平等、と言いたい場合は in different ways です。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"Men and women are wired differently." (男性と女性は脳の構造（配線）がそもそも違う)

"Different strengths and weaknesses." (異なる長所と短所がある)

"Equality doesn't mean sameness." (平等とは「同じであること」を意味しない)

6. ゴルフの楽しみ (22:12 - 24:20)
Original: I enthusiastic about it. Correction: I am enthusiastic about it. / I am hooked on it.

Original: Good aspect of golf. Correction: That's the best part of golf. / That's the beauty of golf.

Original: So it's a small package, small trip. Correction: It's like a mini getaway or a day trip.

解説: ちょっとした旅行気分、という場合は getaway（逃避行、小旅行）がおしゃれです。

Original: the return is very clouded. (※Clouded -> Crowded) Correction: The traffic on the way back is very congested / heavy.

解説: 道が混んでいる場合、"Crowded"（人が多い）よりも "Traffic is heavy" や "Congested"（渋滞している）を使います。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"It's a great way to bond with friends." (友達との絆を深める良い方法だ)

"Getting back to nature." (自然に帰る)

"Stuck in traffic." (渋滞にはまる)

Shoさんへの総合アドバイス
今回のトピック「差別」は、英語ネイティブでも言葉を選ぶ難しいテーマです。それを「植民地支配の歴史」や「人間の本能（グループを作りたがる）」という視点から説明しようとした姿勢は素晴らしいです！

今回のキーポイント:

抽象的な動詞の活用:

Manage to (なんとか〜する)

Assume (思い込む、推測する)

Commute (通勤する)

これらを使えると、文がぐっと大人っぽくなります。

歴史・社会問題の語彙:

Colonization (植民地化) は正しく使えていました！

これに加えて Deep-rooted (根深い) や Resentment (恨み) を覚えると、歴史問題の議論がスムーズになります。

交通渋滞の表現:

Crowded は「電車の中」や「広場」に人がいっぱいいるイメージです。

車の渋滞は Traffic jam, Heavy traffic, Congested を使いましょう。

2026年のWBC、日本開催（予選ラウンド）楽しみですね！大谷選手の話など、好きなトピックだと英語もさらに滑らかに出ると思います。応援しています！

次のステップとして、もしよろしければ、「特定のトピック（例えばWBCについて説明する、仕事の悩みを相談するなど）」の短い英作文を送っていただければ、それを添削することもできますよ。もちろん、またトランスクリプトを送っていただいても構いません！

一個前のやつもうちょっと他の改善点教えて

承知しました！先ほどは「文法」と「言い回し」に焦点を当てましたが、今回は**「論理の組み立て方」や「誤解を避けるためのニュアンス」、そして「さらに一歩進んだビジネス英語」**という視点から、別の改善点を掘り下げます。

Shoさんの会話は内容が濃いので、ここを直すともっと知的で洗練された印象になります。

1. 「ゴルフは重要じゃない」の誤解を防ぐ (22:34)
Original: I think golf is not important. I think, Okay, I like going to some forest area...

解説: ここで "Golf is not important" と言うと、相手は「え？じゃあなんでやってるの？」と一瞬混乱してしまいます。Shoさんが言いたかったのは、「ゴルフのスコアや競技そのものよりも、社交や雰囲気が大事」ということですよね。

修正案（ニュアンスの改善）:

"It's not so much about the game itself, but the experience."

（ゲームそのものというより、体験が大事なんです）

"For me, the score doesn't matter as much as the social aspect."

（私にとっては、スコアは社交的な側面ほど重要ではありません）

"I'm in it for the nature and the company."

（自然と仲間と一緒にいることが目的でやっています）

※ここでの Company は「会社」ではなく「一緒にいる人々/仲間」という意味です。

2. 性別に関する議論をよりスマートに (18:23 - 18:53)
Original: I can't distinguish which is better? I don't know which, which sex is better.

解説: "Which sex is better"（どっちの性が優れているか）と言うと、まるで男女が勝ち負けを競っているように聞こえてしまいます。現代の議論では、「優劣」ではなく**「それぞれの特性」**に焦点を当てる言い方が好まれます。

修正案（より成熟した意見）:

"It's not about who is better. We just have different strengths."

（どっちが上かという話ではなく、強みが違うだけです）

"Each gender brings something different to the table."

（それぞれの性別が、異なる価値を提供しています）

※ Bring something to the table = 貢献する、価値を提供する（ビジネスでも使える重要イディオム）

3. 「差別」の原因を説明する語彙力 (8:23 - 9:05)
Original: We like our human like teams... human won't want teammates... want to find their company.

解説: Shoさんはここで、「人間は本能的に仲間意識を持ちたがる（だから部外者を排除する）」という非常に鋭い心理学的・社会学的な指摘をしようとしています。ここで詰まってしまったのは、**「帰属意識」や「本能」**という単語が出てこなかったからです。

この文脈で使える "Power Words":

Sense of belonging (帰属意識)

Humans have a strong desire for a sense of belonging.

Instinct (本能) / Instinctively (本能的に)

We instinctively favor people who are similar to us. (私たちは本能的に似た人を好みます)

Tribalism (部族主義＝仲間びいき)

Discrimination often comes from tribalism. (差別はしばしば部族主義から来ます)

これらを一つ使うだけで、「チーム」や「チームメイト」という比喩を使わなくても、ズバッと言い表せます。

4. 仕事の説明をプロフェッショナルに (4:00)
Original: I don't need to talk about some clients face to face.

解説: これでも十分通じますが、ビジネス英語には「顧客と直接関わる」ことを指す便利な形容詞があります。それは "Client-facing" です。

修正案:

"My role isn't client-facing."

（私の役割は、顧客対応ではありません＝バックエンドや開発メインです）

"I work mostly on the backend, so I rarely have external meetings."

（私は主にバックエンド業務なので、社外との会議はめったにありません）

5. 「ステレオタイプ」と「差別」の区別 (11:26)
Original: It seems I have money so, but it is not Discrimination...

解説: フィリピンでお金持ちだと思われることについて。これは「差別（Discrimination）」というよりは、**「ステレオタイプ（Stereotype）」や「偏見（Prejudice/Bias）」**という言葉がしっくりきます。

修正案:

"It's more of a stereotype than discrimination."

（それは差別というよりは、ステレオタイプですね）

"They assume all Japanese are rich. It's a common misconception."

（彼らは日本人が皆金持ちだと思い込んでいます。よくある誤解です）

今回の深掘りまとめ
Shoさんの英語は、「言いたい中身（コンテンツ）」のレベルが高いです。そのため、簡単な単語（Good, Bad, Team, Betterなど）だけで表現しようとすると、どうしても子供っぽく聞こえたり、誤解を生んだりするリスクがあります。

次のステージへの鍵:

対比構造を作る: "It's not A, but B" （AというよりはBだ）という構文を使いこなす。（ゴルフの話や、ステレオタイプに話で使えます）

概念を表す名詞: Instinct (本能), Stereotype (固定観念), Perspective (視点) などの抽象名詞を武器にする。

これらを意識すると、Shoさんが日本語で考えている深い思考を、そのまま英語に乗せることができるようになりますよ！

もっと色々な改善点教えてください

Shoさんの英語はすでにかなり高いレベル（特にトピックの深さ）にありますが、さらに**「ネイティブのような自然さ」と「誤解を招かないための配慮」**という観点から、まだ指摘していない細かい、しかし重要な改善点を5つ挙げます。

1. 歴史的な話題での「言葉の選び方」 (13:58)
Original: "...since now, we are already civilized." （今はもう文明化されているので…）

解説: フィリピンの植民地支配の歴史の文脈で「今は文明化された（Civilized）」と言うと、裏を返せば**「昔は野蛮だった（Uncivilized/Barbaric）」というニュアンス**が含まれてしまうリスクがあります。歴史的な議論では、この言葉は非常にセンシティブです。

より適切で知的な表現:

"We are a modern, independent nation now."

（今は近代的で独立した国家です）

"Society has evolved since then."

（社会はそれ以来、進化しました）

"Those are outdated views."

（それらは時代遅れの見方です ※昔の差別の話をする時など）

2. 時制の使い分け：過去完了形は必要？ (20:47)
Original: "when I was a student, I had played baseball for a long time," （学生だった頃、私は野球をずっとやっていた）

解説: ここで had played（過去完了形）を使われていますが、単に「学生時代に野球をしていた」という過去の事実を述べるだけなら、過去形（Past Simple）で十分です。 過去完了（had + pp）は、「過去のある時点（例：大学を卒業した時）よりもさらに前に完了していたこと」を強調する場合に使います。

自然な文法:

"I played baseball for years when I was a student."

（シンプルに過去形でOK）

"I used to play baseball."

（昔はやっていました＝今はやっていない、というニュアンスが出るので便利）

3. 「〜することに成功する」の動詞化 (1:25)
Original: "if I success to go to bed at 12..." （もし12時に寝ることに成功したら…）

解説: これは日本人学習者が非常によく間違えるポイントです。

Success (名詞) = 成功

Succeed (動詞) = 成功する

文法的には If I succeed in going to bed... となりますが、日常会話で「なんとか〜できた」と言うときは、前回も少し触れましたが Manage to が圧倒的に自然です。

修正案:

"If I manage to get to bed by 12..."

（なんとか12時までに寝られたら…）

"If I can make it to bed by 12..."

（12時までにベッドに行けたら…）

4. 考える時間を稼ぐ「つなぎ言葉」 (5:18 - 5:42)
Original: "let me search... maybe I know... let me search" （検索させて…たぶん知ってるけど…検索させて）

解説: オンライン英会話では調べながら話すのもOKですが、"Search" を連呼すると会話のリズムが途切れてしまいます。より洗練された「時間稼ぎ」のフレーズを使うと、沈黙もコミュニケーションの一部になります。

スマートなつなぎフレーズ:

"That's a deep question. Let me gather my thoughts."

（深い質問ですね。考えをまとめさせてください）

"How can I put this..."

（なんて言えばいいかな… ※言葉を探している時に）

"Let me just double-check the exact definition."

（正確な定義をちょっと再確認させてください ※スマホで調べる時に）

5. 「夢中になっている」のバリエーション (22:24)
Original: "I enthusiastic about it," （私はそれに熱心です）

解説: 文法的には I am enthusiastic about it ですが、趣味（ゴルフ）について話す時、"Enthusiastic" は少し硬く、面接のような響きがあります。もっと感情が乗った表現があります。

より自然な「ハマっている」表現:

"I'm totally hooked on it."

（完全にハマっています ※釣り針にかかったように）

"I've really gotten into it recently."

（最近、のめり込んでいます）

"I'm obsessed with it."

（頭がいっぱいになるくらい好きです）

まとめ：Shoさんの英語を「完成形」に近づけるために
Shoさんはすでに「意味を通じさせる」段階はクリアしています。次のステージは**「文脈に合った単語のチョイス（Register）」**です。

歴史の話 → 誤解を生まない慎重な言葉（Modern vs Civilized）

趣味の話 → カジュアルで情熱的な言葉（Hooked vs Enthusiastic）

日常の話 → シンプルな文法（Simple Past vs Past Perfect）

このように、**「TPOに合わせた英語の着せ替え」**を意識すると、エンジニアとしての知的なバックグラウンドと、親しみやすい人柄の両方がより相手に伝わるようになりますよ！

you would like to talk about. Honestly, I didn't choose I didn't choose any specific topics. Do you have any suggestion?

S

Sarah

4:47

Okay, so,

S

Sarah

4:53

how about the topic number one or number



Sho Ishikawa

4:56

two? Okay, okay, let's talk about Wow, this. Okay,

S

Sarah

5:02

yeah, discrimination,

S

Sarah

5:04

okay, so what comes on your mind when you hear the word discrimination,



Sho Ishikawa

5:13

discrimination,



Sho Ishikawa

5:18

let me search, yeah, actual meaning, discrimination, okay, maybe I know, but it's serious meaning, I think so maybe such. Yeah, yeah,

S

Sho Ishikawa

5:37

oh.



Sho Ishikawa

5:42

We when I heard discrimination, when I hear



Sho Ishikawa

5:48

I think that discrimination, it's



Sho Ishikawa

5:58

tough topic.



Sho Ishikawa

6:01

Sometimes. And



Sho Ishikawa

6:03

every



Sho Ishikawa

6:06

a lot of people discuss about this topic,



Sho Ishikawa

6:12

even now maybe I mean even current, current, yeah, all over the world.

S

Sarah

6:26

Yeah, that's correct.



Sho Ishikawa

6:28

I imagine this word that is related to some inter internet country, country or skin,



Sho Ishikawa

6:46

country, area and the skin, I think,

S

Sarah

6:49

yeah. And also here, when we talk about, like, language, right? Yeah, yeah. So sometimes, like, since we are not native speaker of English, sometimes, yeah, some, like, they discriminate how we pronounce the words about our accent, yeah? Sometimes it happened, oh, yeah, even here in Philippines, yeah, because we have, like, Filipinos have a thick accent, yeah, some, some Filipinos discriminate other Filipinos because of the thick accent of speaking. Okay, it also happened,



Sho Ishikawa

7:31

I thought some over us, student, discrete,

S

Sarah

7:37

ah, no, no, no, I've never encountered,



Sho Ishikawa

7:42

yeah, you are student, yeah, describe,

S

Sarah

7:49

yeah, discriminating, discriminating, okay, yeah, I've never had any



Sho Ishikawa

7:54

experience, okay,

S

Sarah

7:56

yeah, that's good, yeah, It means that Japanese people are good, yeah, okay, yeah, so in that case, Sho, why do you Think that discrimination exists?



Sho Ishikawa

8:17

Yeah, is



8:21

it a

S

Sarah

8:22

difficult topic for you?



Sho Ishikawa

8:23

We like our human like teams, and human won't want



Sho Ishikawa

8:33

teammates.



Sho Ishikawa

8:40

Such, yeah, somebody



Sho Ishikawa

8:51

Yeah, humor, always want their fellow him, want to find their company also,



Sho Ishikawa

9:05

yeah, and want to create some more target, opposite,



Sho Ishikawa

9:17

then discrimination.



Sho Ishikawa

9:19

It's happened. I think

S

Sarah

9:21

I see okay, yeah, because, like, yeah, as what you said, We want someone like, much with our personality, much with our characteristics, yeah, much with Yeah. So that's why discrimination happened. So how about on your own experience? Have you ever tried it somewhat discriminate, you or no.



Sho Ishikawa

9:46

Maybe no,

S

Sarah

9:48

no, that's good.



Sho Ishikawa

9:50

I've never, never happened. I never experienced this situation.

S

Sarah

9:58

But have you like have you witnessed? Have you ever witnessed like discrimination?



Sho Ishikawa

10:07

It is difficult to judge the discrimination is, yeah, it depends on Sho. Sho,



Sho Ishikawa

10:21

it's difference what they what we think and what we feel.



Sho Ishikawa

10:33

If I go to some,



Sho Ishikawa

10:41

yeah, it's



Sho Ishikawa

10:49

difficult if I go to



Sho Ishikawa

10:52

Philippine and I,



Sho Ishikawa

10:59

I am if I go to Philippine, I can be target over some third children and



Sho Ishikawa

11:13

third children and some other People to Yeah, because I am Japanese, I am a foreigner, so



Sho Ishikawa

11:26

it seems I have money so, but it is not Discrimination, I think. But some of Japanese feel that we just to our list,



Sho Ishikawa

11:51

but it's small discrimination and we in the past, yeah, it's big reason about discrimination, I think, yeah, previously, Some country, embedded, embedded, actual, yeah, yeah, so colonized,

S

Sarah

12:20

yeah. Colonized



Sho Ishikawa

12:23

previously in the past, so yeah, colonize the country.



Sho Ishikawa

12:33

Country people have have feeling, some negative feeling about the colonizing country people even,

S

Sarah

12:50

yeah,



Sho Ishikawa

12:54

it's a normal feeling and normal emotion,

S

Sarah

12:59

yeah, yeah, that's right.



Sho Ishikawa

13:04

I Yeah, that is what I want. I meant I wanted to say,

S

Sarah

13:09

yeah, yeah, yeah. You know also Philippines experience, like, being colonized by Spain, yeah. And so Filipinos, like, we also the experience discriminated by this pain, because yeah, because of the looks, yeah, and because of the status, yeah, especially the social status, like rich and poor first people, yeah, they're discrimination. It's likely to happen between the social status, so that's why we also had a bad experience with Spain. Yeah, Spain before, but since now, we are already civilized. Like, yes, what you said? It's not likely to happen now, nowadays. Okay, so in that case, yeah, how can we how can we avoid discrimination?



Sho Ishikawa

14:03

So it's difficult, yeah, okay, it's difficult because previously,



Sho Ishikawa

14:14

it previously some country, colonized some country, and it



Sho Ishikawa

14:26

is sorry, let me search, okay, Sho,



Sho Ishikawa

14:33

it is fact. It is reality, yeah,



Sho Ishikawa

14:36

so



Sho Ishikawa

14:39

we can change the past, fact, we can't change first past fact, so



Sho Ishikawa

14:49

Some of people have



Sho Ishikawa

14:56

negative feeling.



Sho Ishikawa

14:59

Country, yeah, but we



Sho Ishikawa

15:07

honestly, we realized. We honestly, we know about



Sho Ishikawa

15:17

now, now, now people don't have, didn't, don't do that, but

S

Sarah

15:26

yeah, that's correct, we



Sho Ishikawa

15:29

know, but it's difficult to,



Sho Ishikawa

15:35

It's difficult to arrange, my our emotion,



Sho Ishikawa

15:42

yeah, so, yeah, it happened



Sho Ishikawa

15:46

everywhere.

S

Sarah

15:47

Yeah, that's correct, even in social media like Facebook or Instagram. Yeah. There's also discrimination, yeah. So do you think that discrimination and bullying is the same.



Sho Ishikawa

16:04

Yes, same, I think so,

S

Sarah

16:05

yeah, yes, it's saying, okay, yep. So how about you? Sho like, if you ever, like, get discriminated, how would you react?

S

Sarah

16:17

You get discriminated for?



Sho Ishikawa

16:23

Honestly, I have not, I've never experienced so I'm not sure, but if I, if I, how

S

Sarah

16:36

would you react if I am



Sho Ishikawa

16:38

discriminated I would if I was discriminated, I



Sho Ishikawa

16:45

I, if I am discriminated, I will



Sho Ishikawa

16:50

React, React to nothing, react, silence.

S

Sarah

16:54

Ah, I see, ignore,



Sho Ishikawa

16:57

ignore them.

S

Sarah

16:59

Yeah, you will just ignore it. Yeah, I think it's the best.



Sho Ishikawa

17:03

Just ignore it. But have negative emotion about that, about those people, and then



Sho Ishikawa

17:12

go to my room and go to bed, eat a lot.



Sho Ishikawa

17:20

Story, yeah, to convert my story,

S

Sarah

17:24

yeah, okay. Is that what you do when you get stressed, you eat a lot,



Sho Ishikawa

17:30

yes, oh,

S

Sarah

17:34

yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, we will be like we we will be hurt, right? It's great for our feelings, but we you will just ignore it, and then, yeah, as you said, you will go to your room and eat a lot

S

Sarah

17:54

and go to sleep early.



Sho Ishikawa

17:57

Best solution,

S

Sarah

17:58

yeah, yeah, to forget everything.

S

Sarah

18:02

Yeah, Okay, last question, do you think males and females are equal?



18:13

The



Sho Ishikawa

18:23

Hmm, it's not equal. I think,

S

Sarah

18:26

aha, okay, but



Sho Ishikawa

18:29

I can't.



Sho Ishikawa

18:31

I can do I can't specify. I can't distinguish which is better? I can't, yeah, I can't. I don't know.



Sho Ishikawa

18:47

I don't know which, which sex is better,

S

Sarah

18:53

okay, yeah, yeah, okay. But for you, it's not equal, but you can't define who is more better, yeah, I see Yeah, because we Yeah,



Sho Ishikawa

19:08

because what?

S

Sarah

19:10

Okay, because we have different like, we, we are unique, right? We have different characteristic, we have different abilities. Yeah, okay, and

S

Sarah

19:24

I see okay in Philippines, in Philippines, yeah. You know, it's been like an issue before, if we consider male and female as the same or equal, yeah. And so a lot of females said, Oh, we can do the things that the men do, yeah, but, but for me, I think yes, sometimes what, especially when it comes to physical activity, right? So there are some activities that women can do, yeah, but men can do, but there are some also, like, unique characteristic of women that men can't do also, yeah. So I think, yeah. I think it's equal.

S

Sarah

20:11

Yeah, it's equal in different pace. Yes.

S

Sarah

20:16

Okay, all right, yet, so much for that topic. A Sho. So this time, let's have another topic. How about let's talk about sports.



Sho Ishikawa

20:25

Okay,

S

Sarah

20:27

okay. Do you play any sports?



Sho Ishikawa

20:30

Yes, I recently started to play golf.

S

Sarah

20:37

Okay, how about before, when you were student,



Sho Ishikawa

20:40

when I was a student, I had played baseball for a long time,

S

Sarah

20:47

Sho Ishikawa

S

Sarah

22:00

Sho Ishikawa

22:24

I enthusiastic about it,

S

Sarah

22:28

Sho Ishikawa

Shoさん、話者分離されたトランスクリプトのご提示ありがとうございます！ Shoさん（Sho Ishikawa）と先生（Sarah）の発言が明確になったおかげで、Shoさんが**「何を言おうとして、どこで言葉に詰まったか」**がより鮮明に分析できました。

今回は「差別（Discrimination）」という非常に抽象的で難しいトピックに挑戦されていますね。この議論をより深く、かつ誤解なく伝えるための**「ロジックの整理」と「大人の英語表現」**を中心に、徹底的に解説します。

1. 睡眠と仕事の柔軟性 (1:25 - 2:45)
Original: If I success to go to bed at 12, and I'm so happy. Correction: If I manage to go to bed by 12, I'm happy.

再確認: 前回もお伝えしましたが、この文脈での "success" (名詞) の動詞化は、日常会話では "manage to" (なんとか〜する) が最適です。

Original: I don't need to go to my office... talk about some clients face to face. Correction: Since I work remotely, I don't need to commute or have face-to-face client meetings.

解説: "I work at home" も正しいですが、職種（エンジニア）的に "Work remotely" がプロフェッショナルです。「通勤」は "Commute" です。

2. 「差別」の原因論：人間の本能 (8:23 - 9:19)
Shoさんはここで、「人間は自分と似た人と一緒にいたがる（だから差別が生まれる）」という高度な社会心理学的な話をしようとしています。

Original: We like our human like teams... human won't want teammates... want to find their company... create some more target, opposite.

分析: "Team" や "Company" という言葉で「仲間意識」を表現しようとしていますが、これだとスポーツや会社の話題に聞こえてしまうリスクがあります。

✨ Advanced Revision (ネイティブレベルの論理構成):

"It stems from human instinct."

（それは人間の本能に由来します。）

"Humans instinctively want to belong to a group of like-minded people."

（人間は本能的に、考えの似た人々のグループに属したがります。）

"This creates an 'Us vs. Them' mentality, which leads to discrimination."

（これが「我々 対 彼ら」という心理を生み、差別につながります。）

重要単語:

Instinctively (本能的に)

Like-minded people (似た考えを持つ人々、同志)

Us vs. Them (内集団と外集団の対立)

3. 「お金持ちだと思われること」は差別か？ (10:52 - 11:26)
Original: If I go to Philippine, I can be target over some third children (※street children?)... it seems I have money so, but it is not Discrimination...

分析: フィリピンで「日本人＝金持ち」と思われてターゲットにされる話です。Shoさんは「これは差別（Discrimination）とはちょっと違う気がする」と直感的に感じていますが、その正体は**「ステレオタイプ（Stereotype）」**です。

✨ Logic Upgrade: この3つの違いを使い分けると、議論が非常にクリアになります。

Stereotype (認知): 「日本人は金持ちだ」という固定観念。

Prejudice (感情): 「だから気に入らない/好きだ」という感情。

Discrimination (行動): 「だからお金を要求する/店に入れない」という実際の行動。

Correction:

"They assume I'm rich because I'm Japanese." (彼らは私が日本人だから金持ちだと思い込んでいます。)

"That's more of a stereotype than discrimination." (それは差別というよりは、ステレオタイプですね。)

4. 歴史的背景と植民地 (12:33 - 13:04)
Original: Country people have have feeling, some negative feeling about the colonizing country people even, it's a normal feeling...

分析: 「植民地支配された側の国民が、支配した国の人に対してネガティブな感情を持つのは普通だ」という文脈です。ここでの "Normal" は「当たり前だ、理解できる」という意味で使われています。

✨ Better Phrases:

"It's understandable that they still harbor resentment."

（彼らが未だに恨みを抱いているのは理解できます。）

※ "Normal" だと「それが正常（正しい状態）」と聞こえることがあるので、"Understandable"（無理もない、理解できる）がベストです。

"Historical grievances don't disappear overnight."

（歴史的な恨みつらみは、一晩では消えません。）

5. ゴルフの渋滞と楽しみ方 (23:41 - 24:00)
Original: So it's a small package... (small tripと言い直し) Correction: It's like a mini-getaway.

解説: 小旅行は "Getaway" がおしゃれです。

Original: but the return is very clouded. (※Clouded -> Crowded) Correction: The traffic on the way back is heavily congested. / We get stuck in traffic on the way back.

解説: 前回も触れましたが、車の混雑に "Crowded" は使いません。"Traffic is heavy" か "Congested" です。

6. WBCと大谷選手 (25:22)
Original: So he is best, best player in all words about. (※all over the world?) Correction: He is arguably the best player in the world.

解説: "Best player" と断言してもいいですが、議論の余地なくすごい、という意味を込めて "Arguably" (ほぼ間違いなく) をつけると、客観的な視点を持った大人の表現になります。

Shoさんの英語の「伸びしろ」ポイント
今回のトランスクリプトから、Shoさんは**「自分の言いたい概念（本能、ステレオタイプ、歴史的感情）」を持っているのに、それにぴったり合う「英単語のラベル」**が見つからずに、知っている単語（Team, Company, Normal）で代用して苦労している様子が見受けられました。

今後の戦略: 言いたいことが抽象的になった時こそ、以下の「概念ワード」を使ってみてください。

Instinct (本能): "Humans like teams" ではなく "It's human instinct."

Stereotype (固定観念): "They think I have money" ではなく "It's a stereotype."

Understandable (無理もない): "It's normal" ではなく "It's understandable."

これらを使うだけで、Shoさんの知的な思考がそのまま相手に伝わるようになります！応援しています。

解説: "I have no way" だと「方法がない」という意味になります。「従うしかなかった（選択肢がなかった）」と言いたい場合は "I had no choice" が決まり文句です。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"My dad twisted my arm." (父に無理やり説得された ※直訳は腕を捻るですが、比喩表現です)

"He wouldn't take no for an answer." (彼はNOという返事を受け入れなかった＝強引だった)

5. サッカーから野球へ「転向させられた」 (16:05 - 16:26)
Original: my father changed my club soccer to baseball. Correction: My father made me switch from soccer to baseball.

解説: お父さんが書類上の手続きをしたというより、Shoさんに「変えさせた」という強制力が働いているので、使役動詞 "Made me switch" が最も状況を表しています。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"He steered me towards baseball." (彼は私を野球の方向へ誘導した)

"I followed in his footsteps." (（結果的に）彼の足跡をたどった＝同じ道を進んだ)

6. 父には「勝てない」 (17:50 - 18:00)
Original: I don't have mind to win my father. Correction: I don't intend to beat my father. / I don't think I can beat him.

重要: ここは非常に大切なポイントです。

Win = 試合や賞品を勝ち取る (Win the game, Win a prize)

Beat = 対戦相手を打ち負かす (Beat my father, Beat the team) "Win my father" と言うと、「父を賞品として獲得する」という不思議な意味になってしまいます。

7. 仕事の不満と転職理由 (18:57 - 19:31)
Original: Sho language is Japanese. (※Company language?) Correction: The official language of the company is Japanese.

Original: Project boarding is boring. Repetition of job. Correction: The project I'm on is boring. It's just repetitive work.

解説: "Repetition"（反復）という名詞より、形容詞 "Repetitive"（繰り返しの多い、単調な）を使うと、「つまらない」というニュアンスが強く出ます。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"It's a dead-end job." (将来性のない仕事)

"I'm stuck in a rut." (マンネリ化している)

"Same old, same old." (毎日同じことの繰り返しだ)

8. 残業への耐性 (24:13 - 24:32)
Original: I have over time worker skills every day. Correction: I have the stamina to work overtime every day. / I'm used to working overtime.

解説: 「残業スキル」という表現は面白いですが、英語では「体力がある（Stamina）」や「慣れている（Used to）」と表現するのが自然です。

Original: I have those skills, but I didn't. I don't use it decently. Correction: I have the capacity, but I don't use it currently because the job is boring.

解説: "Decently"（きちんとした）より、文脈的には "Currently"（現在は）や "Recently"（最近は）と言いたかったのかと推測します。

✨ Better Idioms / Phrases:

"I can burn the midnight oil." (夜遅くまで働ける)

"I'm willing to put in the hours." (長時間働く意欲がある)

9. AIへの懸念 (25:00 - 25:31)
Original: I was scary about, I'm afraid of AI belong evolving. Correction: I'm scared of AI evolving. / I'm worried about AI taking over our jobs.

解説:

I am scared. (私は怖い＝感情)

It is scary. (それは怖い＝対象の性質) "I was scary" と言うと、Shoさんが「（周囲の人にとって）恐ろしい人だった」という意味になってしまいます。

Shoさんへの総合フィードバック（今回の会話から）
今回のトランスクリプトは、Shoさんの**「家族（お父さん）」と「仕事（エンジニア）」**という2つの大きな軸が見えて、とても興味深かったです。

さらに上達するための3つのポイント:

「勝つ」の使い分け (Win vs Beat):

ダイアグラムでも示しましたが、対戦相手（父、敵チーム）には必ず Beat を使いましょう。これは必須スキルです！

使役動詞の活用 (Make/Let/Have):

お父さんとの関係（ゴルフ、野球）を話すとき、My father made me ~（父が私に〜させた）や My father let me ~（父が私に〜させてくれた）を使えると、親子関係のニュアンスがより正確に伝わります。

形容詞の使い分け (Scared vs Scary):

自分の感情は -ed (Scared, Bored, Excited)。

物事の性質は -ing または形容詞 (Scary, Boring, Exciting)。

I am boring と言ってしまうと「私はつまらない人間だ」になってしまうので注意です！（正しくは I am bored）

Shoさんの英語は、自身の状況（仕事の悩みや家族との関係）を率直に伝えようとする力が強く、それが先生との良いコミュニケーションに繋がっています。この調子で、細かい文法（Beat/Winなど）を修正していけば、さらに自信を持って話せるようになりますよ！
